### Complete sqlite SQL query
### SQLite SQL tables , with their properties:
#
# repair(repair_ID,name,Launch_Date,Notes)
# machine(Machine_ID,Making_Year,Class,Team,Machine_series,value_points,quality_rank)
# technician(technician_id,Name,Team,Starting_Year,Age)
# repair_assignment(technician_id,repair_ID,Machine_ID)
#
### What are the names of the technicians that are assigned to repair machines with more point values than 70?
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables repair_assignment,machine,technician,and join them on repair_assignment.Machine_ID = machine.Machine_ID and repair_assignment.technician_id = technician.technician_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns Name.No aggregation function is required on column Name.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: machine.value_points > 70.0.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T3.Name FROM repair_assignment AS T1 JOIN machine AS T2 ON T1.machine_id  =  T2.machine_id JOIN technician AS T3 ON T1.technician_ID  =  T3.technician_ID WHERE T2.value_points  >  70
