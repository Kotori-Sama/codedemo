### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the team names of the universities whose enrollments are smaller than the average enrollment size.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables university,basketball_match,and join them on university.School_ID = basketball_match.School_ID.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns Team_Name.No aggregation function is required on column Team_Name.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: university.Enrollment < {'from': {'table_units': [['table_unit', 1]], 'conds': []}, 'select': [False, [[5, [0, [0, 18, False], None]]]], 'where': [], 'groupBy': [], 'having': [], 'orderBy': [], 'limit': None, 'intersect': None, 'union': None, 'except': None}.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT t2.team_name FROM university AS t1 JOIN basketball_match AS t2 ON t1.school_id  =  t2.school_id WHERE enrollment  <  (SELECT avg(enrollment) FROM university)

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the distinct last names of all the students who have president votes and whose advisor is 8741.
Let's think step by step:
The problem shows that we should intersect two queries.
Considering the first query:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables Student,Voting_record,and join them on Student.StuID = Voting_record.President_Vote.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns LName.No aggregation function is required on column LName.Meanwhile, the user wants to query distinct values of column.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
Considering the second query:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables Student.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns LName.No aggregation function is required on column LName.Meanwhile, the user wants to query distinct values of column.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: Student.Advisor = "8741".
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.

### Find the distinct last names of all the students who have president votes and whose advisor is 8741.
Let's think step by step:
The problem shows that we should intersect two queries.
Considering the first query:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables Student,Voting_record,and join them on Student.StuID = Voting_record.President_Vote.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns LName.No aggregation function is required on column LName.Meanwhile, the user wants to query distinct values of column.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
Considering the second query:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables Student.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns LName.No aggregation function is required on column LName.Meanwhile, the user wants to query distinct values of column.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: Student.Advisor = "8741".
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.

### Find the team names of the universities whose enrollments are smaller than the average enrollment size.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables university,basketball_match,and join them on university.School_ID = basketball_match.School_ID.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns Team_Name.No aggregation function is required on column Team_Name.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: university.Enrollment < {'from': {'table_units': [['table_unit', 1]], 'conds': []}, 'select': [False, [[5, [0, [0, 18, False], None]]]], 'where': [], 'groupBy': [], 'having': [], 'orderBy': [], 'limit': None, 'intersect': None, 'union': None, 'except': None}.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT t2.team_name FROM university AS t1 JOIN basketball_match AS t2 ON t1.school_id  =  t2.school_id WHERE enrollment  <  (SELECT avg(enrollment) FROM university)

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables university,basketball_match,and join them on university.School_ID = basketball_match.School_ID.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns Team_Name.No aggregation function is required on column Team_Name.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: university.Enrollment < {'from': {'table_units': [['table_unit', 1]], 'conds': []}, 'select': [False, [[5, [0, [0, 18, False], None]]]], 'where': [], 'groupBy': [], 'having': [], 'orderBy': [], 'limit': None, 'intersect': None, 'union': None, 'except': None}.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT t2.team_name FROM university AS t1 JOIN basketball_match AS t2 ON t1.school_id  =  t2.school_id WHERE enrollment  <  (SELECT avg(enrollment) FROM university)

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns LName.No aggregation function is required on column LName.Meanwhile, the user wants to query distinct values of column.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
Considering the second query:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables Student.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns LName.No aggregation function is required on column LName.Meanwhile, the user wants to query distinct values of column.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: Student.Advisor = "8741".
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

#
### Find the distinct last names of all the students who have president votes and whose advisor is 8741.
Let's think step by step:
The problem shows that we should intersect two queries.
Considering the first query:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables Student,Voting_record,and join them on Student.StuID = Voting_record.President_Vote.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns LName.No aggregation function is required on column LName.Meanwhile, the user wants to query distinct values of column.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.

#
### Find the team names of the universities whose enrollments are smaller than the average enrollment size.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables university,basketball_match,and join them on university.School_ID = basketball_match.School_ID.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns Team_Name.No aggregation function is required on column Team_Name.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: university.Enrollment < {'from': {'table_units': [['table_unit', 1]], 'conds': []}, 'select': [False, [[5, [0, [0, 18, False], None]]]], 'where': [], 'groupBy': [], 'having': [], 'orderBy': [], 'limit': None, 'intersect': None, 'union': None, 'except': None}.

#
### Find the team names of the universities whose enrollments are smaller than the average enrollment size.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables university,basketball_match,and join them on university.School_ID = basketball_match.School_ID.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns Team_Name.No aggregation function is required on column Team_Name.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that the limiting conditions should be: university.Enrollment < {'from': {'table_units': [['table_unit', 1]], 'conds': []}, 'select': [False, [[5, [0, [0, 18, False], None]]]], 'where': [], 'groupBy': [], 'having': [], 'orderBy': [], 'limit': None, 'intersect': None, 'union': None, 'except': None}.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is no need to limit the number of results.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT t2.team_name FROM university AS t1 JOIN basketball_match AS t2 ON t1.school_id  =  t2.school_id WHERE enrollment  <  (SELECT avg(enrollment) FROM university)

### Find the first name, last name and id for the top three players won the most player awards.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables player,player_award,and join them on player.player_id = player_award.player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns name_first,name_last,player_id.No aggregation function is required on column name_first.No aggregation function is required on column name_last.No aggregation function is required on column player_id.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column player_id should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that column count(*) should be used for sorting,and the order is DESC.
Analyzing the composition of the limit clause:the problem shows that there is need to limit the number of results,and the number is 3.
So, the final output SQL statement is:
SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T1.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN player_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 3;

#
### Find the team names of the universities whose enrollments are smaller than the average enrollment size.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables university,basketball_match,and join them on university.School_ID = basketball_match.School_ID.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns Team_Name.No aggregation function is required on column Team_Name.
