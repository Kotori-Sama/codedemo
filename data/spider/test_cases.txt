### Show all product names and the number of customers having an order on each product.
Let's think step by step:
Analyzing the composition of the from clause, based on the problem information, we should choose tables Order_Items,Products,Orders,and join them on Order_Items.product_id = Products.product_id and Orders.order_id = Order_Items.order_id.
Analyzing the composition of the select clause, the problem shows that the user wants to query information for columns product_name,*.No aggregation function is required on column product_name.There should be an aggregation function for count on column *.
Analyzing the composition of the where clause, the problem shows that no limiting conditions are required.
Analyzing the composition of the group by clause:The problem shows that column product_name should be used for grouping.
Analyzing the composition of the order by clause:The problem shows that no columns should be used for sorting.
